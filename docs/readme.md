## Game Pillars
### Tactical Combat
Our turn-based combat system structure will be based on a tactical/strategy format with a few changes.

### Narrative
Dialogues and the rest of the narrative elements as well as the locations and places let the player find out and investigate about the history and consequences of the place where the game takes place.

### Aesthetics
Aesthetics and consistency in design are a really important part of the game, that is based largely on a cat related look. Almost every element of the game and graphical design references the fact that almost every character in the game is a cat and the design is inspired by it.


## Story & Narrative Structure
In the past of a magical and peaceful world where cats and dogs lived in society, a laboratory began to experiment with the creation of a rare and powerful artifact "The Ball of Golden Wool".
A catastrophe occurred, The Ball got out of control and unleashed a calamity on the spiritual world. Natural disasters began to occur all around, earthquakes, tornadoes.... Leaving the whole city in ruins. 

That was only the beginning, many creatures were left corrupted, soulless by the artifact, attacking every living creature. As time went by, society was divided in half, as the dogs thought the cats were guilty and the cats thought the dogs were to blame.

After 100 years of riots and fighting between cats and dogs, the canines have managed to get hold of The Ball of Golden Wool to investigate it and put an end to the cats.
Although The Ball of Golden Wool is not so easy to use, and will require a special user...

## Gameplay Features
